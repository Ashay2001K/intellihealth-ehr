# IntelliHealth

IntelliHealth is a decentralized Electronic Health Record (EHR) system designed to enable secure, patient-centric medical data management using blockchain technology and decentralized storage.

The project explores how blockchain can be used to improve data integrity, access control, auditability, and trust in healthcare information systems.

---

## Overview

Traditional EHR systems rely on centralized architectures, which introduce risks related to data breaches, unauthorized access, and lack of transparency. IntelliHealth addresses these challenges by combining blockchain-based access control with off-chain decentralized storage for medical records.

The system allows patients to retain control over their health data while enabling authorized healthcare providers to access records securely and transparently.

## Key Features

- Patient-controlled access to medical records  
- Blockchain-based authorization and auditability  
- Secure off-chain storage of medical data using IPFS  
- Backend services for record management and access workflows  
- End-to-end system integrating backend, blockchain, and storage layers  

---

## System Architecture

The system is designed as a full-stack application composed of the following components:

- **Client**  
  User-facing application for interacting with medical records and managing access permissions  

- **Server**  
  Backend services responsible for application logic, APIs, and metadata handling  

- **Blockchain Layer**  
  Smart contracts used to enforce access control policies and maintain immutable audit trails  

- **Decentralized Storage**  
  Medical records stored off-chain using IPFS, with on-chain references for integrity verification  


- ## Tech Stack

- Backend: Python (Django)  
- Frontend: Web-based client application  
- Blockchain: Ethereum smart contracts  
- Storage: IPFS  
- Database: Relational database for metadata
